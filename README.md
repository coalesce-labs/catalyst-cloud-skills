# @catalyst-cloud/cli

[![skills.sh](https://skills.sh/b/coalesce-labs/catalyst-cloud-skills)](https://skills.sh/coalesce-labs/catalyst-cloud-skills)

## Install

Run the installer, then type `/catalyst-onboard` in your coding agent:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://staging.catalystcloud.dev/install.sh | sh
```

The installer puts the CLI and both skill packs on this machine and connects it with one browser approval. It ends by printing the next step. Then open a new session of your coding agent in any directory and type `/catalyst-onboard` (`$catalyst-onboard` in Codex). The onboarding skill reads where this machine stands and walks you through the rest one step at a time. It asks before it writes anything to your machine. Everything else on this page is the reference it follows.

This repository supplies skills for setting up and operating your Catalyst Cloud account. A coding workstation also uses [`coalesce-labs/catalyst-dev-skills`](https://github.com/coalesce-labs/catalyst-dev-skills) for research, planning, implementation, review, and shipping.

Or by hand. One command, for every coding agent on the machine:

On an existing machine, inspect same-named skill paths before running either add command. The
commands replace existing directories and links; the inspection rule is below.

```sh
npx skills@latest add coalesce-labs/catalyst-cloud-skills --all -g
```

It installs every skill in the bundle for each agent it detects (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode and the rest). A coding workstation also installs the development pack:

```sh
npx skills@latest add coalesce-labs/catalyst-dev-skills --all -g
```

The two packs have different jobs and independent versions. Omit `-g` for a project-scoped Cloud skills install. Copied skills do not auto-update. Re-adding the pack also picks up newly added skills; `npx skills update` refreshes only names already in the lock. Before an add or refresh, inspect the active global lock at `$XDG_STATE_HOME/skills/.skill-lock.json` when XDG state is set, or `~/.agents/.skill-lock.json` otherwise. A project install uses its own `skills-lock.json`. Check every same-named agent path, not just the canonical lock entry. Proceed only if each destination is absent or a verified, unmodified copy of the intended pack or its symlink. Leave independent, changed, or uncertain copies in place. Do not schedule raw add commands as an unattended refresh. After that check, re-run the Cloud add command above with `-g` for a workstation or without `-g` inside a project.

<details><summary><strong>Alternative for Claude Code: the plugin marketplace</strong></summary>

The plugin installs this pack's same `skills/` tree as a managed bundle that updates when we ship. It needs a GitHub SSH key, and it does not load into the session you are already in — run `/reload-plugins` or restart afterwards. Pick one rail for this pack; installing both leaves you with every skill twice. The development pack has its own optional Claude plugin, `catalyst-dev@catalyst-dev-skills`.

```
/plugin marketplace add coalesce-labs/catalyst-cloud-skills
/plugin install catalyst@catalyst-cloud
```
</details>

<details><summary><strong>One agent at a time</strong></summary>

Codex:

```sh
npx skills@latest add coalesce-labs/catalyst-cloud-skills -a codex
```

Cursor:

```sh
npx skills@latest add coalesce-labs/catalyst-cloud-skills -a cursor
```

OpenCode, Amp, Windsurf and the rest:

```sh
npx skills@latest add coalesce-labs/catalyst-cloud-skills
```

Without `--all` the installer asks which skills to take and which agents to install them on.
</details>

### Then connect to your cloud account

The skills call one CLI, and the CLI holds your credential. Install it once and connect this machine — the keyless way logs you in as yourself, with nothing to mint or paste:

```sh
npm install -g @catalyst-cloud/cli
catalyst login
catalyst ready
```

`catalyst login` with no key opens a device-code login: it prints a short code and a URL, you approve it in your browser, and this machine is connected as you. On a machine with no browser (a remote box, a container) the code and URL still work — approve them from your phone. The short-lived session refreshes silently afterwards, so you log in about once a year. `npx -p @catalyst-cloud/cli catalyst login` works without the global install, and `bunx` works in place of `npx`. A non-default cloud is set with `CATALYST_CLOUD_BASE_URL` or `--base-url <url>`.

Prefer a key? Pass one instead — mint a **personal key** at Settings → API keys in the Catalyst Cloud app (every member can; no admin needed). The environment form keeps it out of your shell history:

```sh
CATALYST_CLOUD_TOKEN=<your-personal-key> catalyst login
```

`--key <your-personal-key>` is the third form, for a script.

After a workspace owner connects your cloud account's Linear workspace, connect your personal Linear account. Connect your personal GitHub account only after the workspace's GitHub App is installed and its repository is registered. These personal grants are separate from the workspace's Linear connection and GitHub App installation. Your agent can start each connection and check whether it landed, but you approve each one in your browser:

```sh
catalyst connections personal linear start
catalyst connections personal linear status
# First install the workspace's GitHub App and register its repository in Settings.
catalyst connections personal github start
catalyst connections personal github status
```

Each `start` prints a short-lived URL and attempts to open your browser. On a remote machine, open the printed URL on your own device. `status --json` gives the same result to an agent; `start --wait 60` waits up to one minute for approval. A connected result is the proof that the grant landed. If a provider reports unavailable, retry status later rather than starting a second approval.

The `catalyst-onboard` skill checks both grants before taking you through the rest of setup and the first ticket.

The command is `catalyst`. `catalyst-skills` still works as a deprecated alias, and `@catalyst-cloud/catalyst-skills` is the deprecated package name that forwards to this one.

## What this is

A set of skills that let your coding agent run your own Catalyst Cloud account (https://staging.catalystcloud.dev) from your seat: what is happening, what needs you, and what to do about it. They read your account through the Catalyst Cloud SDK, write to it through the account's agent proxy, and never compose a URL or run a tool of their own; every read, write and subscription is a `catalyst` verb with `--help`. Every skill is plain Markdown under `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` in this repository, and your own login — a keyless device-code session, or a personal key — is the only credential. Your agent acts as you: the asks it raises and the comments it posts carry your name, and "what needs me" means you.

## What connecting does

`login` does three things: it calls `GET /api/v1/me` with your credential, which discovers your cloud account and who you are from the credential alone; it writes `~/.config/catalyst-cloud/customer.json` with file mode `0600`, holding your credential (a keyless login session, or a personal key), who you are (id, label, role, your Linear user id) and the absolute path of the CLI so every skill script can spawn the same binary; and it fetches your account's contract (`GET /api/v1/agent/contract`) and caches it at `~/.config/catalyst-cloud/contract.json` with its ETag, so stage names and ids, label ids, the ask template, thresholds and the route table come from your account, live, and no skill restates them.

A keyless session's access token is short-lived and rotates on its own: every request refreshes it within a minute of expiry and rewrites the config atomically, so you stay connected for months without logging in again. You only log in again if the session is revoked or you have been away long enough to lapse — then one clear line tells you to run `login`.

`login` does not install skills; the install command above did that. Re-running `login` after a key rotation, or to switch rails, rewrites the config. `catalyst status` prints which cloud account this machine is connected to and as whom, `catalyst ready` prints one READY or NOT READY verdict with the fix for each failure and who can apply it, and `catalyst --version` prints the package version and its pinned contract range.

The setup skill Catalyst seeds into your repository ends by pointing at this same command. That served skill lives in the Catalyst Cloud application, not here; this is the only connect step a customer runs. Your cloud account's **account key** (Settings → Account keys, admin-minted) is a different credential — for a host or daemon that runs unattended — and is not what a person connects their own agent with: it would strip your name from everything your agent writes, and `login` says so if you use one.

## Run and resume setup

Run `catalyst onboard` for the steps supported by your installed CLI and cloud. The command shows its plan, opens supported browser consent links and saves progress. Resume with the same command; it rechecks completed steps before continuing. A missing cloud capability stays unfinished.

```sh
catalyst onboard --dry-run --json
catalyst onboard
catalyst ready --onboarding --json
```

The dry run writes no files. `--only <step>` runs one step and reports its scope separately from full onboarding. Exit 10 means a failed step, 11 means waiting, and 12 means a guard refused the action. The private receipt is `install/last-run.json` under your machine's Catalyst state directory; credentials stay in the login config. A fake HOME reports old services and keeps them intact.

Local sync is optional. Include it in the plan with `--local-sync` when you need local SQL or offline access. A resume keeps that choice. Readiness distinguishes failed checks from missing evidence and reports observed project work separately from unfinished setup.

## Requirements

- Node 22.15 or newer (Node 26 works), or bun 1.4 or newer. The bundle uses Node's built-in SQLite module (and, on bun, bun's own `node:sqlite`) for the optional local replica, so there is no native dependency to build; if `better-sqlite3` resolves on the machine it is used instead. `catalyst ready` names the exact reason when the runtime is too old, and `catalyst runtime install` installs a pinned Node under this CLI's own cache — without touching your machine's default Node — if you would rather not upgrade it.
- Your personal key, minted by you at Settings → API keys. The key is the only account selector: you never type an account id. If your Linear identity is not matched yet, `login` says so; you match it yourself with `catalyst identity linear set` (an identity someone else already claims needs an admin at Settings → Members), and until then "what needs me" shows everyone's asks.
- An agent that discovers skills. Claude Code loads the plugin; Codex, Cursor, OpenCode and the rest read the `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` files the `npx skills` installer writes.
- Bun is optional, only if you prefer `bunx` over `npx` — bun 1.4 or newer, which is when `node:sqlite` arrives; older bun cannot run this CLI at all.

## First use

Open a new session and ask about your own cloud account. The skills read the config `login` wrote. For example:

- What's happening? Where are we, why is that stuck, what closed, what's next?
- What needs me?
- Run this project for me until it closes.
- Am I set up?

`catalyst team list` inventories visible teams without running readiness checks. `team check ENG` prints readiness for one team; `team check --all` runs checks for every team. `team map ENG`, `team adopt ENG`, and `team migrate ENG` print a plan and exit 3 before changing configuration; review the plan and rerun the chosen command with `--yes --plan-hash <hash>` from that preview. `team adopt ENG --undo` previews the exact previously created stages, and `team migrate ENG --retire` requires its own confirmation after the ticket move. `team checklist ENG` prints the same manual setup lines as the browser. These commands use the member's own login; an admin or owner seat is required for setup, and Adopt and Migrate also need that member's personal Linear connection.

## What has to be running

Nothing, by default. After `login`, every read, write, ask and explanation goes to the cloud's origin-fresh API with the config file and the cached contract on disk. Two optional processes exist for people who want them:

| process | needed for | what it holds on disk | lifetime |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| none | every read, write, ask and explain | `customer.json` and `contract.json` | the default after login |
| `catalyst replica start` | local SQL, cheap repeated reads, and local event `tail`, `wait-for`, and `query` | one SQLite file plus a bounded event cache under `$XDG_STATE_HOME/catalyst/events/` (fallback `~/.local/state/catalyst/events/`) | one long-running process; foreground by default, `--detach` writes a pidfile beside the database and returns; `login --start-replica` does the same at the end of login |
| `catalyst watch` | a project owner reacting to its scope | one cursor file (`~/.config/catalyst-cloud/watch-cursor.json`) stamped with the account | lives inside the session that armed it; exits with it |

The check every skill runs first is `catalyst replica status`, which needs no network: is the pidfile's process alive, is the writer-lock heartbeat younger than the staleness threshold, and is the cursor non-empty. It exits `0` for fresh, `1` for present but stale, `2` for not connected, `3` for absent, and prints one line either way (`--json` for scripts). A fresh replica is used; anything else falls back to the API and the skill says so in its answer. A skill never refuses to work because the replica is down and never silently reads a stale one. `replica status --probe` compares the local cursor against the cloud's head for the honest "how far behind" number; that is the only form that touches the network. `catalyst replica stop` stops a detached writer.

`catalyst events status --probe` checks the event cache's own cursor and compares it with the cloud head; `replica status --probe` checks the separate entity-replica cursor. A fresh replica does not prove event freshness. `events tail` follows new cached events, `events wait-for --ticket ... --timeout ...` performs a bounded wait, and `events query` reads retained history. Those three commands only read the cache; `events status --probe` makes the cloud comparison. The replica process is the single writer and reports an event-sync failure without terminating a healthy entity replica. The event cache keeps closed daily segments for at most seven days or 256 MiB per account and reports an explicit gap when a requested sequence has retired.

The replica is a Node process, not a service: the supported path is the plain command, and `skills/catalyst-onboard/references/local-sync.md` gives launchd and systemd examples for people who want the writer to survive a reboot.

## The skills

| skill | what the person says | what it does | file |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `catalyst-onboard` | "Set me up. I just signed up. Am I set up? What is missing? Log me in." | Walks you from nothing to your first ticket running, one step at a time: connect this machine, connect the workspace and your personal provider accounts, map one project, register one repository, then watch a card move. Afterwards it answers "am I set up?" with one READY or NOT READY verdict and who can fix each failure, logs a machine in again, and checks the optional local replica. Hands over browser consent and settings steps without claiming they happened until a status check confirms them. | [`SKILL.md`](skills/catalyst-onboard/SKILL.md) |
| `whats-happening` | "What's happening? Why is that stuck? How does this work? How does it prioritise?" | The desk for your account: reads the contract, what is running and queued, the eligibility explainer, the coding accounts and the open asks, and answers in one reply with ticket ids. Carries the facts behind the answers: the ladder, the stage map, failures, parks and holds, the queue order and every reason a ticket is excluded. Routes work to a project owner and decisions to `what-needs-me`. | [`SKILL.md`](skills/whats-happening/SKILL.md) |
| `what-needs-me` | "What needs me? What am I blocking?" | The human's decision inbox, ranked by how much open work each ask holds, and the one way an agent raises a decision on their behalf: files an ask through the cloud's ask route with the account's own template and records the answer so the held work releases. | [`SKILL.md`](skills/what-needs-me/SKILL.md) |
| `run-this-project` | "Run this project for me. Own it until it closes." | Single-threaded owner of one project: subscribes to the account's event stream for its scope, reacts to each change in the same turn, makes tickets ready and moves them to dispatch, parks what should stop, chases stalls, escalates inward, and keeps one status summary current. Never polls. | [`SKILL.md`](skills/run-this-project/SKILL.md) |
| `catalyst-linear` | "Show me the ticket, the history, what Catalyst wrote on it." | Reads a ticket with its comments, relations, labels, linked pull requests and agent sessions inline, from the replica when fresh and the API otherwise, always naming the source; writes comments, card moves, labels and new tickets as the app actor; knows what a ticket accumulates as Catalyst works it. | [`SKILL.md`](skills/catalyst-linear/SKILL.md) |
| `catalyst-github` | "Show me the PR, the checks, the review, the queue." | A ticket's pull request with its checks, reviews and review threads; whether it is mergeable under the repository's policy; what a PR accumulates as the ticket moves (the branch, the draft, the rewrite, the force-pushes, the labels, the queue). | [`SKILL.md`](skills/catalyst-github/SKILL.md) |
| `unstick` | "Why is this parked? Unpark it. Get things flowing again." | Reads why a ticket is not running and every park or hold on it, decides whether the recorded cause is fixed, previews the release and releases it the right way from your own login — or one failure class across a team — and raises an ask only for what a person has to do. | [`SKILL.md`](skills/unstick/SKILL.md) |
| `what-this-repo-needs` | "What env vars does this repo need? What belongs in its environment declaration?" | Scans a repository offline — no login, no network — and lists the environment variable names it needs, grouped build/test, deploy-only and bindings, each with where it was found, what uses it, and where a local value would come from. Never reads or prints a value. Also checks TOML syntax and the environment variable table in `.catalyst/catalyst.toml`. | [`SKILL.md`](skills/what-this-repo-needs/SKILL.md) |

Some of these only read, and some write: a comment, a card move, an ask, a release. Your agent may pick any of them from what you ask. Picking a skill is not permission to write: each write goes through your own login, spends the daily write budget your account sets, and is recorded against your name, and the skills preview first where the product offers a preview (a release's dry run, a stage mapping's plan). Each skill's `agents/portability.yaml` says whether it writes. Every skill declares `allowed-tools` scoped to this package's own binary, so none of them needs a blanket shell grant.

## What a key cannot see yet

Your personal key reads everything the skills need — tickets, pull requests, the eligibility explainer, the dispatch queue, fleet activity, per-ticket execution history (`catalyst explain --history <ticket>`: phase attempts, remediation rounds, park state) and coding-account status (`catalyst accounts`: provider, declared and observed state, window usage, walls, quarantine — never a credential; enrolling or pausing one is `<your cloud>/settings/coding-accounts`). It also releases a parked or held ticket once its cause is fixed: `catalyst release <ticket> --because <what changed>` (the `unstick` skill runs it), recorded against your name and shown in the ticket's history. And it declares what your containers need: `catalyst environment` reads the account-wide declaration, `environment propose --file <path> --approve` proposes and approves it in one compare-and-set, and the values behind the names stay in the cloud — reading needs any active seat, proposing and approving need an admin or owner one. An admin or owner can put a repository's values in from the terminal. `catalyst secret import .env --repo owner/name` stores every name in the file and lists the declared names that still have no value. `catalyst secret set NAME --repo owner/name --command 'op read op://Vault/item/field'` runs the command on your machine and stores its output; with no `--command` it reads the value from stdin, or asks for it without echoing. No value is ever printed, and the cloud's audit records the command, not its output. That is the account's own declaration — a repository's own `.catalyst/catalyst.toml`, which `catalyst-onboard` already reports on, is a separate thing. `catalyst env inventory` lists the environment variable names a repository needs — never a value; `env check` checks the TOML syntax and environment variable table in `.catalyst/catalyst.toml` offline; `env migrate [catalyst.env.json]` prints a TOML environment table from a legacy declaration, with all names optional and values omitted. These commands need no login (the `what-this-repo-needs` skill walks through them). Two things it cannot do, and the skills say so by name rather than guess:

- Read pull-request labels or the reviewer's reaction. The mirror does not carry them; GitHub's own page does.
- Compute a flow number — cycle time, throughput, or how long pull requests have been open. Nothing serves those yet, so say they are not computed rather than counting something else and calling it that.

## Versions and origins

The package pins the contract range `1.x || 2.x`, recorded in `package.json` under `catalystCloud.tenantContractRange`, and reports it in `--version`, `status` and `login`. An account whose contract version falls outside that range is refused with one line naming both versions; update the bundle. Every skill carries a `vendored-from:` line naming this package as its origin, and that line now also carries the version it was vendored at; all of them are written in this repository for customer accounts.

## What it writes on your machine

- `~/.config/catalyst-cloud/customer.json`, written with mode `0600`, holding your personal key, who you are, and the CLI path.
- `~/.config/catalyst-cloud/contract.json`, your account's cached contract.
- `~/.config/catalyst-cloud/published.json`, the cached answer to "what is the newest release" — no credential in it.
- Only if you start them: `~/.config/catalyst-cloud/replica.db` with its `.pid`, `.writer.lock` and `.writer.state` sidecars, `$XDG_STATE_HOME/catalyst/events/<tenant>/backbone/` (or the home-directory fallback) with bounded daily event segments, and `~/.config/catalyst-cloud/watch-cursor.json`.

The skill files themselves are written by whichever install command you ran, in that tool's own location. Your personal key goes into that one config file and nowhere else.

## Updating

A plugin install updates when we ship. Skills copied by `npx skills add` do not. After the source and destination check in Install, re-run the Cloud add command to refresh existing skills and pick up new ones. Update the CLI with `npm install -g @catalyst-cloud/cli@latest && catalyst login` — the re-login rewrites the CLI path the skills spawn, so they stop running the old bundle. To run one command against the latest publish without installing, use `npx -p @catalyst-cloud/cli@latest catalyst login`. The next `catalyst` run prints a one-line notice:

```
[catalyst] updated 0.1.1 → 0.2.0: <that version's CHANGELOG.md summary> · update with: npm install -g @catalyst-cloud/cli@latest && catalyst login
```

A `customer.json` written by an older bundle is still read unchanged; it gains the CLI path and the cached contract the next time you run `catalyst login`.

`catalyst ready` also says when either the installed skills or the CLI is behind the latest publish, naming both versions and the command for each; it is a note, never a failure, and `--offline` (or `CATALYST_SKILLS_OFFLINE=1`) skips the lookup.

## Uninstalling

Remove the skills the way you installed them: `/plugin uninstall catalyst@catalyst-cloud` in Claude Code, or delete the skill directories (`catalyst-github`, `catalyst-linear`, `catalyst-onboard`, `run-this-project`, `unstick`, `what-needs-me`, `what-this-repo-needs`, `whats-happening`) from wherever `npx skills add` wrote them. Skills an earlier release shipped (`catalyst-setup`, `connect-me`, `how-catalyst-works`) go the same way; the CLI removes its own stamped copies of them when it installs or refreshes skills. Then remove what the CLI wrote:

```sh
catalyst replica stop
rm -f ~/.config/catalyst-cloud/customer.json ~/.config/catalyst-cloud/contract.json ~/.config/catalyst-cloud/published.json ~/.config/catalyst-cloud/watch-cursor.json
rm -f ~/.config/catalyst-cloud/replica.db ~/.config/catalyst-cloud/replica.db.pid ~/.config/catalyst-cloud/replica.db.writer.lock ~/.config/catalyst-cloud/replica.db.writer.state
rm -rf "${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/catalyst/events"
npm uninstall -g @catalyst-cloud/cli
```

## If login fails

- `catalyst: GET /me failed (401): credential not accepted — mint a personal key at Settings → API keys and log in again` — the key is stale, mistyped or revoked. Mint a new one, then run `login` again.
- `catalyst: GET /me failed (403): account-not-operational` — your cloud account is suspended. This is a conversation with your account's admin, not a local fix.
- `catalyst: could not reach <url>: <detail>` — the machine cannot reach the cloud. The URL is named in the message; check `CATALYST_CLOUD_BASE_URL` or `--base-url`.
- A line naming two contract versions after `Connected to` — your account serves a contract outside this bundle's `1.x || 2.x` range. The config is written; update the bundle before using the other skills.
- `[catalyst] GET /api/v1/agent/contract refused (403): this cloud is older than the bundle …` on stderr — the cloud has not yet deployed personal-key access to the contract. Update the cloud, or connect with your account key until it has.

## License

MIT — see [LICENSE](LICENSE). How to contribute and how releases happen are described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). The install commands above are one canonical block kept in [`.agents/install-block.md`](.agents/install-block.md); change them there first.

### Unmatched Linear identity

Personal Linear consent normally binds the provider viewer automatically. For an unmatched identity, inspect your choices and explicitly select yourself:

```sh
catalyst identity linear status
catalyst identity linear options --json
catalyst identity linear set <linearUserId>
```

The command uses your personal credential and reads the result back after selection. It cannot change another member, replace an automatic match, or take an already-claimed identity. A missing options field means no choice was offered, which can include a temporarily unreadable roster. This command depends on the pending SDK 0.12.0 release with identity support.
