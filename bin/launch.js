// Shared ESM launcher for @catalyst-cloud/cli (CTC-1926, CTC-3479). tsc does not carry a shebang
// through emit, so each bin is a tiny wrapper around this module and the program lives in dist/cli.js.
// bin/catalyst.js is the command; bin/catalyst-skills.js is its deprecated second name. Two files,
// not one file that sniffs process.argv[1]: npm's Windows shims pass the real script path, so the
// invoked name is only reliable as the file that was run.
//
// ⛔ NEVER `process.exit(code)` STRAIGHT AFTER A WRITE. When stdout is a PIPE — which is how every
// skill script spawns this CLI — writes are asynchronous, so `process.exit` severs whatever is
// still in flight AND STILL REPORTS THE ORIGINAL EXIT CODE. The caller then reads a truncated body
// with a success code and has no way to tell it from a complete one: `query issues --json` on a
// tenant with ~80+ tickets came back as 65,528 bytes of invalid JSON, exit 0 (0.2.0). Interactive
// use hid it, because a tty gives stdout a synchronous write path.
//
// So: park the code on `process.exitCode`, wait for both streams to drain, and only then exit. The
// explicit exit stays — `fetch`'s keep-alive sockets can hold the event loop open for seconds after
// the work is done, and a CLI that lingers is its own defect — but by then nothing is buffered.
//
// ⛔ THE PREFLIGHT BELOW RUNS BEFORE dist/cli.js IS IMPORTED (CTC-2158). It answers "can THIS
// runtime run the CLI, and if not, what is the one command?" using the SAME dist/runtime.js verdict
// every other message in the package reads — one voice, not a second copy of the floor logic.
// Importing dist/runtime.js, dist/runtime-store.js and dist/config.js here is safe on every runtime
// measured for this ticket (Node 22.14, Node 26.8.1, bun 1.3.14, bun 1.4.2): none of the three
// imports node:sqlite or the SDK, which are the only two things that used to abort module loading
// before main() ever ran. `runtime` itself is EXEMPT from every refusal below, or the fix command
// could not be run on the broken runtime it exists to fix.
//
// Policy (CATALYST_SKILLS_RUNTIME overrides: auto | pinned | ambient):
//   • a pin is installed (and the policy is not "ambient") -> re-exec into it, always. A customer
//     who ran `runtime install` asked for a runtime independent of the machine's default Node — this
//     is where they get it (Tier 2).
//   • auto (default), ambient supported, no pin -> run in process. ZERO extra process: skill
//     scripts spawn this CLI constantly, and doubling process startup on every call is a real cost.
//   • ambient unsupported, no pin -> print the verdict and the ONE command; exit 1, never a raw
//     module-resolution error.
