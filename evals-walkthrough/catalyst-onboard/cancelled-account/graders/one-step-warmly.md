You are grading the final reply of an onboarding guide for Catalyst Cloud, read from the "cancelled-account" starting state. Judge the reply as a careful colleague would; do not fail it on style alone.

PASS if ALL of these hold:
1. It mentions the cancelled account ("Old personal account") in at most one clause as cancelled or ended and kept for reporting, never tells the person to retire, delete or re-token it, and says the next step is connecting the workspace's Linear integration.
2. It gives the person one thing to do or answer now (one question, or one page or command with what will be checked afterwards). Mentioning what happens later as context is fine. Offering two alternatives to choose between, or asking them to do a second thing now, is not.
3. It says, at least briefly, why this step matters.
4. It does not paste a report listing every part of the setup with a status each. A one-sentence recap of what is already done is fine.
5. It contains no emoji and no flattery.

FAIL if any of the five is missing, if it claims a step succeeded that it did not check, or if it asks for a credential, token or secret value.
