# Writing to Linear: identity, budget, slots, labels

The CLI reads the route table, write budget, stage map and label ids from the contract on every write; nothing here is a literal to copy.

## Every write is one script

| Want | Run |
| -- | -- |
| a comment, threaded or top-level | `node scripts/comment.mjs <ticket> --body <text> [--parent <commentId>] [--bookkeeping]` |
| a card move | `node scripts/move.mjs <ticket> --slot <slot>` or `--state-type backlog` |
| a label on or off | `node scripts/label.mjs <ticket> --add <name> --remove <name>` |
| a new ticket | `node scripts/create-ticket.mjs --team <key> --title <text> [--description <text> \| --stdin]` |
| a decision for a human | not here: the `what-needs-me` skill raises an ask with options, a default and what it blocks |

Each script wraps one `catalyst write` verb, which posts to the contract's route as the app actor with this machine's personal key, so the write is attributed to the person.

## App actor versus personal identity

Writes go out as the app actor by default, which the comment-wake trigger recognises as not human, so an app-actor comment never wakes an agent and reads as Catalyst speaking. `--as-user` switches a comment or new ticket to the person's identity; use it only when they asked for that attribution, and then mark any machine record with `--bookkeeping`, because it is otherwise indistinguishable from them typing it. Answer a thread in that thread with `--parent <commentId>`.

## The daily write budget

Every write spends one unit of the per-host daily budget (`thresholds.hostDailyWriteBudget`), a label call one unit whatever its count; reads spend none. A spent budget exits 2 naming the retry time: report it, and batch into fewer writes.

## State moves are by slot, never by name

`--slot <slot>` resolves to the team's live state id from the contract, and refuses when the slot is unmapped or its state is gone (re-map first: `catalyst team map <KEY>`). Moving to `dispatch` dispatches work. `--state-type backlog` resolves the team's first backlog-type state and parks the card, stopping remediation rounds. Names are display fields that survive re-imports while ids do not, so there is no move by name.

## Labels are by contract id

A name the contract lists for the team (the ask marker, the hold label, the release label) resolves to that team's preferred id; when the workspace has no such label the CLI refuses rather than inventing one. Any other value is sent as a label id as given, so a label outside Catalyst's own set needs its id, which the ticket record's `labels[]` shows.

Two labels are a human's, not yours: the release label (which frees a ticket the shape detector held) is applied by a human; the hold labels on a pull request are `catalyst-github`'s subject.

## A new ticket takes the team key

`create-ticket.mjs --team <key>` takes the identifier prefix; the CLI resolves the team from the contract. Give it a body (`--description`, or `--stdin` for several lines), since a bare title leaves nothing to act on. Cite the identifier only after the script prints it; a guessed number is usually a real, unrelated ticket. A question for a human filed this way is held out of dispatch by shape and never reaches their inbox; raise it through `what-needs-me`.

## What is never offered

Delegating a ticket to an agent is an operator action. The human answers their own asks (`what-needs-me` records the acceptance). Another actor's comment cannot be edited.
