# Coding accounts

snapshot.mjs --accounts omits credentials/emails. An owner/admin enrols, pauses, removes or replaces credentials at `<their cloud>/settings/coding-accounts`.

Slots identify credentials, not emails. Claude/GLM/Qwen use Claude CLI, Codex uses Codex; GLM/Qwen also use OpenCode. Routing names the model.

Declared state is operator-set active/disabled. Observed health is healthy/degraded/unknown, polled every five minutes for active slots and daily for disabled ones. Credential conflicts/auth mismatches quarantine; Replace credential on the account's page clears it.

Providers can limit how much one account runs in a period. An account at its limit (walled) is left alone until it can run again. Hitting a limit mid-phase ends that phase's session. Where the provider reports an account's usage, a phase is offered only to an account with room to finish it. Some accounts take several phases at once up to a cap; others take one. A provider's status page does not show one account's limits.

When idle, explain. routing_unavailable or no_eligible_account_slot points here. Read --accounts: empty means no enrolment; inspect walled, quarantined and reason. Silence proves nothing.
