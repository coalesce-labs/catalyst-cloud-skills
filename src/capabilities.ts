// capabilities.ts — what this CLI can do on a person's behalf, as a machine-readable table. A setup
// guide reads it instead of carrying its own list of verbs, so when a verb lands here the guide
// stops sending the person to a page for it, and when a verb is missing the guide says "update the
// CLI" rather than inventing a command. Each capability names the role the cloud requires for it
// and the contract routes it rides; availability is judged against the CACHED contract only, so
// this verb never reaches the network and never blocks. Every new setup route gets a row here and a
// guide line that offers it; a page link for a step with a row is a bug.
