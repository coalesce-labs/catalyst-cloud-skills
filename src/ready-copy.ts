// ready-copy.ts — CTC-4680: what `catalyst ready` says about a team, in words a person can act on.
//
// The check ids, states and reason codes stay in `--json` (`id`) for scripts. The `line`, `fix` and
// `who` a person reads never carry a check id, a reason code, an API route or the word "tenant", and
// every fix is either a full URL or a step in Linear's own settings. `line` keeps its `team KEY: `
// prefix because install.sh strips exactly that before printing a team row.
